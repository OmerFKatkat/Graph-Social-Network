# Graph-Based Social Network Analysis
This project implements a graph data structure to model and analyze relationships within a social network. Each individual in the network is represented as a vertex, and relationships are modeled as edges.

Features:
  Graph Representation: Using vertices for people and edges for relationships.
  Friend Suggestions: Based on common friends, similar occupations, or age.
  Network Metrics:
              Degree Centrality
              Clustering Coefficient
  Community Detection: Utilizing the Girvan-Newman Algorithm to identify groups within the network.
  Command-Line Interface: A menu-driven program for user interaction and social network analysis.
